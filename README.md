# 🌐 Multi-Region Disaster Recovery with AWS and Terraform

The objective is to design and implement a **multi-region disaster recovery** solution using AWS services, where infrastructure is deployed in **two AWS regions**.

This solution will:
- Replicate data across regions
- Ensure high availability
- Implement an automatic **failover mechanism** for disaster recovery

The project uses:
- 🛠️ **Terraform** to provision infrastructure
- ✅ AWS services like VPC,EC2, RDS, S3, Route 53, and Load Balancers
